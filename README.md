## Purpose: About RainBowNoir
RainBowNoir is a wed-based platform that offers a secure and transparent environment for comprehensive reviews of companies and products. Our assessments encompass broad categories like amenities while also integrating specific insights from neurodiverse individuals. These unique perspectives illuminate details that others might overlook or undervalue.

### Why the project is useful

It allows the integratiom specific insights from marginalized communities such as Black, queer, or neurodiverse individuals. These diverse perspectives shed light on nuanced details that might be overlooked or underestimated by others, enriching the depth and accuracy of our reviews.

# How users can get started with the project

## Folder Navigation 
For both frontend and backend folders i have given detailed information to potray my logic in the ReadMe's in each corresponding folder for example App.jsx & Main.jsx are in the [src folder](packages/frontend/src) The corresponding [Readme](packages/frontend/README.md) can be found in the root frontend folder.

## Launch the app to a live environment 
Use the Link

## Locally running the app
1. From the [frontend](**packages/frontend**) folder run:

### `npm install`

This will ensure that all package dependencies needed to run, test and build the app are downloaded from the internet first.

Once done, you can run any of the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the backend insuring the DB is ready and Node is running.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

To quit running the app, press `Ctrl`+`C`

   
## 2.  From the [backend](packages/backend) folder run:

   ### `npm install`

This will ensure that all package dependencies needed to run, test and build the app are downloaded from the internet first.

Once done, you can run any of the following commands:

### `npm run start-dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

To quit running the app, press `Ctrl`+`C`

# Design
## UI Design

Initially my design included a Login, Signup, & Forgotten Password Page for added security, However due to time constraints it was not implimented

## Diagrams

# Tech

## TechStack
1.  **✅Frontend**: Utilise React for creating user interfaces, Tailwind for Styling
2.  **✅Backend**: Build an API using Node.js and Express.js
3.  **✅Database**: MongoDB for data storage, Imagebb for Image storage (Due to memory constraints i had to seperate the 2 databases as not to slow down the app
4.  **❌Deployment**: AWS
